/**
 * All runtime lambdas implement this interface.
 * In addition to apply(), which takes a single (possibly
 * tupled) argument, each lambda must also implement an
 * invoke() whose signature conforms to its scattered arg list.
 * invoke() should be static if the lambda has no captured bindings.
 * invoke() is called in generated code in contexts where a
 * strongly-typed reference to the lambda is available. (Also,
 * standard practice is to have apply() always delegate to
 * invoke()).
