 * Reference resolver. {@link #resolve} method resolves reference terms,

 * dependencies in scopes, and tracking variable capture in lambdas.
 * Also resolves type name refs in type terms, both in declared type annotations
 * (in lets and lambdas) and in type defs. Type name resolution is done here rather
 * than in a separate pass because value and type expressions are entangled.
